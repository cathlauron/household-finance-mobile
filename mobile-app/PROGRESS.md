Household Finance Mobile App — Progress Log

This file tracks what's been built so far. Claude reads this at the start of every session, but always double-checks the actual code too, since notes can drift from reality.

✅ Done

Phase 0 — Decisions & Foundation
- 0.1 — Sync decision: Chosen. No syncing between phones for now — each phone/profile will have its own separate data. Real multi-phone syncing is deferred to Phase 9, later in the roadmap, by design.
- 0.2 — Blank Expo project created and confirmed working.
- 0.3 — Offline behavior and minimum phone OS version decided (see Decisions below).

Phase 1 — Security & Sign-In (M1–M2)
- 1.1 — Data model setup. Done.
- 1.2 — Create-profile & sign-in screens, with password protection. ✅ Complete.
- 1.3 — Encrypt the data at rest. ✅ Complete.
- 1.4a — Quick PIN unlock: set-a-PIN screen + safe storage. ✅ Complete.
- 1.4b — "Lock" uses the quick PIN screen instead of full sign-out, once a PIN is set up. ✅ Complete.
- 1.4c — Auto-lock timer. ✅ Complete. Backgrounding the app and idling both trigger the lock screen, confirmed on a real device.

Phase 2 — Getting Around the App (M4)
- 2.1 — Bottom tab bar with all 10 main sections. ✅ Complete.
- 2.2 — Basic theming (colors/light-dark mode) ported over from the web app. ✅ Complete.

Phase 3 — Calendar (M5)
- 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 — Full Calendar tab (month grid, tap-a-day, running balance projection). ✅ Complete.

Phase 4 — Accounts (M6)
- 4.1, 4.2 — Full Accounts tab (add/edit/delete Cash, Debit, Credit accounts; balance calculation engine). ✅ Complete.

Phase 5 — Bills / Debts / Loans (M7) — ✅ FULLY COMPLETE
- 5.1 — Add/edit/delete Bills. ✅ Complete.
- 5.2 — Add/edit/delete Debts. ✅ Complete.
- 5.3 — Loans, fully complete (list/add/edit/delete, To-Pay pill, Payoff Simulator). ✅ Complete.
- 5.4 — Recurring schedules (monthly, custom, etc.) for Bills, Debts, and Loans. ✅ Complete.

Phase 6 — Transactions (M8) — ✅ CORE COMPLETE (CSV import still optional/outstanding)
- 6.1 — Unified transaction list. ✅ Complete.
- 6.2 — Manually add a transaction, incl. receipt photo attachment, edit/delete. ✅ Complete and confirmed working on a real phone.
- 6.2b — Manual transactions now have a real "Belongs to" person picker (matching Income's pattern), replacing the previous hardcoded owner: 'shared'. ✅ Complete and confirmed working on a real phone.
- 6.3 — CSV import: NOT yet done. Explicitly optional/deferrable per the roadmap.

Phase 7 — Income & Savings (M9) — ✅ FULLY COMPLETE
- 7.1 — Income sources with pay schedules. ✅ Complete.
- 7.2 — Savings goals + Emergency Fund/FI calculators. ✅ Complete and confirmed working on a real phone.

Phase 8 — Groceries / Travel / Events / Goals (M10) — ✅ FULLY COMPLETE
- 8.1 — Grocery list + calculator. ✅ Complete and confirmed working on a real phone.
- 8.2 — Travel checklist. ✅ Complete and confirmed working on a real phone, including real savings-goal auto-sync (tripFullChecklistTotal/syncTripSavingsGoal), verified in an earlier session.
- 8.3 — Events + Year-End Goals. ✅ Complete and confirmed working on a real phone, including Events' own savings-goal auto-sync (syncEventSavingsGoal), mirroring Travel's pattern, verified in an earlier session.

Phase 10 — Dashboard & Reports (M12–M13) — 🔧 IN PROGRESS
- 10.1 — Core dashboard charts. ✅ Complete and confirmed working on a real phone.
- 10.2 — Reports pages. 🔧 IN PROGRESS — eight of the original nine report pages are done and confirmed working on a real phone (Monthly Close-out, Year in Review, Cash-Flow Forecast, Person Spending, Weekly Digest, Merchant Spending, Subscription Audit, Tax Summary). Still to build: Payment Methods — deliberately deferred, see note below.
  - Tax Summary: src/screens/reports/TaxSummaryReport.tsx, wired into ReportsScreen.tsx as an 8th pill. Shows year-picker, total income/expenses/saved, an "Interest & Fees Paid" card, and a full (not top-6) expense-by-category breakdown. Confirmed compiling clean via npx tsc --noEmit and confirmed working on a real phone.
  - IMPORTANT LIMITATION, flagged on-screen in the app itself: "Interest & fees paid" only counts loan late fees (a logged loan payment higher than that loan's expectedPayment — same math LoansScreen already uses). Debt-side fees are NOT included, because Debt/BillCycle in types.ts has no feesPortion field at all — there's no data to pull from. This is a real data-model gap, not a report bug.
  - Payment Methods report was explicitly NOT built, by the person's own choice. Root cause: types.ts has no paymentMethod field anywhere (not on BillCycle, Debt cycles, LoanPayment, or ManualTransaction) — the mobile app has never asked "how did you pay for this" anywhere in the UI. Building this report properly requires real screen work first — adding the field to the model AND adding an actual Cash/Debit/Credit picker to the bill/debt/loan payment-logging screens and the manual transaction form — not just a report file. Scoped as its own future checkpoint.

Phase 11 — Settings (M14) — ✅ FULLY COMPLETE
- 11.1 — Categories, Payees, Rules. ✅ COMPLETE. Full add/edit/delete for all three (Categories with color-swatch picker and duplicate-name checking; Merchants & Payees with optional default category; Categorization Rules with up/down reorder arrows since rule order determines match priority, plus amount-range validation). Verified end-to-end on a real phone in an earlier session.
- 11.2 — Notifications (native push). ✅ COMPLETE, WITH FULL REAL ON-DEVICE CONFIRMATION. rescheduleBillNotifications() is called from both loadModel() and saveModel() in DataContext.tsx, non-blocking with silent-fail via .catch(() => {}), so scheduled alerts stay in sync with bill/debt/loan/setting changes automatically. A real test notification was confirmed firing on the person's physical phone in an earlier session via a temporary "Send a test notification in 10 seconds" button. THIS SESSION: that temporary test button was removed from SettingsScreen.tsx (cleanup item), and the app — including real notification behavior — was confirmed still working correctly on the phone afterward. Checkpoint 11.2 is now fully clean and closed out, no leftover debug UI remaining.
- 11.3 — Security & Household & Data. ✅ COMPLETE. Built from scratch and confirmed working on a real phone:
  - **Security (change passphrase):** Verifies the current passphrase is correct first (re-derives a key from it and successfully decrypts existing data) before changing anything. Generates a brand new random salt, derives a new key from the new passphrase + new salt, re-encrypts all in-memory data with it, saves it, updates the profiles index with the new salt, and swaps the in-memory session key so future saves keep working without needing to sign out and back in. Confirmed on-device: changed passphrase, fully closed and reopened the app, signed in successfully with the new passphrase.
  - **Household:** One-line placeholder text noting that sharing data between phones is coming in a future update (Phase 9), matching the earlier Phase 0.1 decision. No functionality built here by design.
  - **Data (backup + clear):** "Save a backup" writes the full decrypted model to a JSON file via expo-file-system and opens the native share sheet via expo-sharing (new dependency, installed in an earlier session) so the file can be saved to Files, emailed, etc. "Clear all data & start fresh" wipes all entries back to defaultModel() after a confirm step, while keeping the same username/passphrase. Both confirmed working on-device — backup successfully triggered the share sheet, and Clear All Data successfully wiped entries while the same login still worked afterward.
  - New files/changes: src/storage.ts (added updateProfileSalt, saveEncryptedProfileData/loadEncryptedProfileData), src/DataContext.tsx (added changePassphrase), src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx (added Security/Household/Data sections). New dependency: expo-sharing (~14.0.8).
  - npx tsc --noEmit passed clean with zero errors.

**PHASE 11 IS NOW FULLY COMPLETE — INCLUDING ALL CLEANUP. NO KNOWN LOOSE ENDS REMAIN IN THIS PHASE.**

---

## 📅 Session entry — Cleanup: removed leftover test-notification button (Checkpoint 11.2 fully closed out)

Short session, entirely cleanup. The previous session (which built out Checkpoint
11.3 and got real on-device confirmation of push notifications working) was cut off
before PROGRESS.md could be updated to reflect the final state — this session's
update backfills that gap in addition to logging the new cleanup work.

**What was done:**
- Removed the temporary "Send a test notification in 10 seconds" button from
  `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`. This button had served its purpose (proving
  real notifications fire on-device, confirmed in the prior session) and was
  flagged in that session's notes as safe-to-remove debug UI.
- Confirmed on a real phone, after the removal, that the app still works correctly
  — notifications specifically, since that's the piece the removed button was
  adjacent to, plus general app behavior.

**Why this matters:** Checkpoint 11.2 had been sitting in a slightly awkward
"functionally done but with leftover debug UI" state across a couple of sessions.
It's now genuinely finished with nothing left over.

🧹 Code health
- No new dependencies. Only file touched: `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` (button
  removed).

⚠️ Known issues / gotchas (non-code)
(All previously logged items still stand except the one resolved below.)
- RESOLVED THIS SESSION: the temporary "Send a test notification" button that was
  previously flagged as needing removal has now been removed and re-confirmed
  working. No longer an open item.
- Previous-session note (still worth remembering): pasted terminal output can
  silently drop lines/commands from view without anything actually being missing —
  always spot-check with a direct ls/cat/grep command if a pasted transcript looks
  incomplete, rather than assuming something failed to run.

📌 Decisions made
(All decisions from prior sessions still stand — nothing new this session beyond
the cleanup itself.)

▶️ Next step

**Phase 11 (Settings) is fully complete, including all cleanup — all three
checkpoints (11.1, 11.2, 11.3) built, confirmed working on a real device, and with
no leftover debug UI.**

The next-biggest items, in no particular order:
1. **Phase 9 (Shared Expenses / Household Linking)** — the hardest technical part of the whole project, previously deferred at Phase 0.1. This is the natural next big phase.
2. **Payment Methods report checkpoint** (deferred from Phase 10.2) — requires adding a paymentMethod field to the data model (BillCycle, Debt cycles, LoanPayment, ManualTransaction) AND a real Cash/Debit/Credit picker UI on the relevant payment-logging screens and the manual transaction form, not just a new report file.
3. **Loans gap in Dashboard/Calendar/Forecast:** Loans still aren't included in the Dashboard's "Amount Owed"/"Due Soon" cards or the Calendar's/Cash-Flow Forecast's running-balance projection — a pre-existing gap in balanceProjection.ts.
4. Smaller loose ends still flagged from earlier sessions: EF/FI calculators still don't auto-pull figures from Bills/Income; Custom recurrence math isn't implemented in recurrence.ts yet (Bills/Debts/Loans data model supports it, but due-date calculation doesn't); neither Travel nor Events converts a completed item into an actual logged expense/transaction yet (both currently only sync a savings goal target).
5. **Optional/deferred from earlier:** Checkpoint 6.3, CSV import for Transactions — explicitly optional per the roadmap, still not built.
